RetroArchive
============

RetroArchive is a modular PowerShell-based tool to manage and convert retro game archives,
starting with CHD file conversions and repository syncing.

Folder Structure:
-----------------
- archive\      : Converted CHD files output
- config\       : Configuration files (settings.json)
- inbound\      : Incoming files to process
- logs\         : Log files (optional)
- scripts\      : Modular PowerShell scripts (functions only)
- tools\        : External tools like chdman.exe and 7z.exe
- retroarchive.ps1 : Main UI and sync script

Getting Started:
----------------
1. Place 'retroarchive.ps1' in your working directory.
2. Run the script with PowerShell: 
   > .\retroarchive.ps1
3. On first run, the script will download and sync the GitHub repository contents.
4. Use the menu options to initialize folders and convert CHD files.

Configuration:

Requirements:
-------------
